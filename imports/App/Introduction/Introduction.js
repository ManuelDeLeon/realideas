        <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <h3>Why did you create this?</h3>
        <p>I really like this concept (give and receive ideas) but similar sites have absolutely no vetting process. You submit an idea and you get 10 lorem ipsums. That won't happen here.</p>

        <h3><i class="caret right icon" />Why share my idea?</h3>
        <p>Chances are that if you haven't worked on your idea by now, you won't do it at all. Share your idea and you might get one or more that you WILL work on.</p>

        <h3><i class="caret right icon" />What do you mean by "real idea"?</h3>
        <p>You need to show that you've thought of it for more than a minute. Things to keep in mind when writing your idea:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What's the problem?</li>
          <li>Who's hurting enough to want to pay for a solution?</li>
          <li>Do you know they're hurting or do you think they are?</li>
          <li>What's the solution?</li>
          <li>How will you reach your audience?</li>
          <li>Are there other solutions out there?</li>
          <li>How is your solution different?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3><i class="caret right icon" />Will you reject bad ideas?</h3>
        <p>No. The bar is "show you've put thought into it" not whether I think your idea is a good one.</p>

        <h3><i class="caret right icon" />How soon will I get my 10 ideas?</h3>
        <p>Typically a few hours. I'm not glued to a screen.</p>

        <h3><i class="caret right icon" />What happens if my idea gets rejected?</h3>
        <p>You'll get an email letting you know. You may modify it or submit another one.</p>

        <h3><i class="caret right icon" />What kind of ideas do I get?</h3>
        <p>When your idea is accepted into the database, you'll get 10 back based on their rating percentile:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>4 from the 66th percentile</li>
          <li>3 from the 33rd percentile</li>
          <li>3 at random</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><i class="caret right icon" />Why get ideas from the bottom 3rd?</h3>
        <p>A few reasons:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>These are real ideas so even the ones in the bottom 3rd are bound to be okay.</li>
          <li>You might get inspiration or put a twist on these.</li>
          <li>It's random so you might not even get a "low quality" idea.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3><i class="caret right icon" />Can I submit more than one?</h3>
        <p>Sure. Keep'em coming.</p>
